## Game Description
**Cubed Phi** is a unique tower defense game where you build towers by collecting bits! The gameplay revolves around acquiring these bits by hovering over particle effects on the screen. These bits can then be used to either re-roll your current deck of cards or place new towers. Each tower has its own abilities, so experimentation is encouraged!

You win by killing all the enemies at the end of a wave, and you fail if even one enemy manages to escape!

- **Experiment with different tower combinations.** Each tower has unique abilities, so don't be afraid to try different strategies!
