# Cubed Phi: Tower Defense Game

## Details 

The game was made for Unoffical Otterjam 2025, you can play it on [Itch.io](https://xor-saber.itch.io/cubed-phi). :>

## Story
No one truly knows how this bizarre piece of nonsenseware slipped past the Iron Curtain. Most Soviet computer scientists agree that the infamous Alan Turing Bug is an exclusively Western anomaly, an unintended consequence of shoddy capitalist programming.

And yet, against all odds, it spread.

Some say it arrived on a smuggled floppy disk, hidden among pirated games and bootlegged operating systems.

## Game Description
**Cubed Phi** is a unique tower defense game where you build towers by collecting bits! The gameplay revolves around acquiring these bits by hovering over particle effects on the screen. These bits can then be used to either re-roll your current deck of cards or place new towers. Each tower has its own abilities, so experimentation is encouraged!

You win by killing all the enemies at the end of a wave, and you fail if even one enemy manages to escape!

## Tips:
- **Always build a bit collector at the start of a level!** This will help you accumulate bits quickly and set up your defenses more effectively.
  
- **Experiment with different tower combinations.** Each tower has unique abilities, so don't be afraid to try different strategies!
